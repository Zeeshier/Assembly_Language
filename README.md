# Assembly Language Programs Repository

## Description

This repository contains a collection of assembly language programs that demonstrate various concepts and operations. Each program is a standalone example, covering a range of topics such as:

- Input/Output operations
- Arithmetic and logical operations
- String manipulation
- Pattern printing
- User input validation

## Programs Included

-  **Basic Calculator**: Takes user input and performs arithmetic operations.
-  **String Conversion**: Converts a lowercase string to uppercase.
-  **Sum Calculation**: Calculates the sum of even/odd numbers between 1 and 100.
-  **Array Storage**: Takes 10 numbers from the user, stores them in an array, and displays the array.
-  **Even/Odd Checker**: Checks whether a user-input number is even or odd.
-  **Character Display**: Takes a character input from the user and displays it on the screen.
-  **Number Comparison**: Compares two user-input numbers and determines their relationship (equal, unequal, greater, lesser).
-  **Alphabet Printing**: Prints the alphabet in both lowercase and uppercase.
-  **Pattern Printing**: Prints right triangle and triangular patterns using numbers.
-  **String Reversal**: Takes a string input from the user and reverses it.
-  **Number Sign Checker**: Checks whether a user-input number is negative or positive.
-  **Character Repetition**: Takes a character input from the user and displays it 100 times on the next line.
-  **Multiplication**: Takes two numbers as input from the user and multiplies them.
-  **Division**: Takes two numbers as input from the user, divides them, and prints the quotient and remainder.

## Getting Started

To run these programs, you will need an assembler and an environment to execute the assembled code. 

## Contributing

If you have any assembly language programs you would like to contribute, please feel free to submit a pull request. Ensure that your program is well-commented and follows the naming conventions used in this repository.
